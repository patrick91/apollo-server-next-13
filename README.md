# Next.js 13 with Apollo Server

This is a minimal example of how to use Apollo Server with Next.js 13.

It uses the
[Apollo Server integration for Next](https://github.com/apollo-server-integrations/apollo-server-integration-next#route-handlers-experimental)
and the experimental app directory.

The server lives inside `app/api/graphql/route.ts`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can also access the GraphQL explorer at
[http://localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql).
